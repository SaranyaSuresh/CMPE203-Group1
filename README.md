How to set up the enviroment of this web application?

1. Install Python 2.7
Python 2.* works better than 3.* for Pinry. Get Python at http://www.python.org.
You can verify that Python is installed by typing python from your shell; you should see something like:
Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Dec 26 2010, 22:31:48)
[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

2. Install Django
Install an official release. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/install/#installing-official-release
To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type python from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django:
>>> import django
>>> print(django.get_version())
1.5.5
You may have another version of Django installed.
Thatâ€™s it!

3. Download the source code and set it up.
python setup.py install

4. Start web server and enjoy.
python manage.py runserver.
